## Eye Movement Exercise
This exercise taught us how to make eyes follow the cursor, pretty cool! The eyes will follow in any direction- up, down, left, right, and in circles!

How to Run:
1. Download files locally
2. Load the index.html file onto your web browser
3. Move your cursor around and watch the eyes follow!

Future Improvements:
1. Make the eyes more realistic
2. Add a face and other faces to follow as well
